# Introduction

Implementation of and experiments based on the QSMNet (https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05627).  
Now CAD-QSMNet is not an implementation of the original QSMNet any more, but we indeed heavily drew inspiration from it.  
This work was done to submit to the [QSM Reconstruction Challenge 2.0](http://qsm.snu.ac.kr/?page_id=30).
